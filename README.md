## Framework

## Css Library Link

1. Animations were used on 3 pages of the header. They have a fade in from the bottom animation.
2. The main Content also has fade in from the bottom, the 4 sections that contain each category of the portfolio. (Home Page)
3. The About page has a services section that has the text zoom and fade in animation.

## Plugins and Fonts
Adobe fonts - Elevon

## Images and content
All the content and images are owned and created by me.

## Css Variables
I did want to change the colors to the figma file but I ended up liking the default colors provided by boostrap. 

## Basic Site map and information
Home, about and contact page are working pages. The initial design was to have minimum content on the front page and have a seperate portfolio page. But due to some suggestions from the UI/UX professor, they asked me to combine the home page and portfolio section into one. All the portfolio content is now on the Home page and the portfolio page currently does not go anywhere. 

The "See More" buttons would lead to another page that would be additional pictures of the same category and some more information about the project. This would require a lot more time on the development so I left it out for this assignment.

## Process

### Design Phase
I began by researching various portfolio pieces to find inspiration for the format and layout of my website. After gathering ideas from different sites, I synthesized them to create a unique design. Given that my content primarily consisted of red and black elements, I selected a theme that complemented my content. Using Figma, I meticulously crafted the design, ensuring it aligned with my vision and brand identity.

### Development Phase
Transitioning from design to coding posed challenges, particularly when integrating Bootstrap into my workflow. Familiarizing myself with Bootstrap's grid system and responsive classes, especially the sm, md, lg, and xl breakpoints, required time and effort. However, once I grasped these concepts, the development process became remarkably smoother. Leveraging Bootstrap's classes allowed me to create a fully responsive site with minimal CSS code, streamlining the development process significantly.

### Final Touches
After establishing the basic layout, I focused on adding additional features and refining the details. This included implementing skip-links, enhancing accessibility functions, and fine-tuning color adjustments to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly experience.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Learning Bootstrap:** Adapting to a new framework like Bootstrap presented a steep learning curve, particularly understanding its grid system and responsive classes.
   
2. **Integration with Design:** Ensuring that the coded implementation matched the design envisioned in Figma required attention to detail and meticulous adjustments.

3. **Final Touches:** Adding finishing touches and implementing additional features, such as skip-links and accessibility functions, demanded thorough testing and refinement.

## Learnings

1. **Efficiency with Bootstrap:** Embracing Bootstrap's grid system and responsive classes streamlined the development process, allowing for rapid prototyping and responsive design.

2. **Attention to Detail:** The importance of meticulous attention to detail became evident throughout the development process, from design implementation to final adjustments.

3. **Continuous Learning:** Embracing new tools and frameworks, like Bootstrap, reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in web development.

By reflecting on these challenges and learnings, I aim to further enhance my skills and approach in future projects, continually striving for innovation and excellence.

### Future development plans
Add a working portfolio section that would go deep into the contents creation.
Add additional pages that would lead the "see more" button to further categories and content information.
